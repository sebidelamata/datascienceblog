<p>After working as a cook for 16 years in cities throughout the US, I went back to school. In December of 2017 I received a BS in Appropriate 
  Technologies and a BA in Spanish Language, Literature, and Cultures from Appalachian State University. In between completing my undergrad degrees and graduate school I started 
  work as a research assistant for the Appalachian State University Department of Economics. There I studied the effect of behavioral "nudges" 
  on residential energy consumption patterns in cooperation with New River
Light and Power and the Appalachian Energy Center. In August of 2019 I received an MS in Applied Data Analytics with a concentration in sustainability analytics, as well as a post-grad certificate in Business Analytics. After completing grad school I began work as a Data Scientist for the Appalachian State University Center for Analytics, Research, and Education. My interests include data science, programming, sustainability, analytics, finance, and being an all-around nerd.
