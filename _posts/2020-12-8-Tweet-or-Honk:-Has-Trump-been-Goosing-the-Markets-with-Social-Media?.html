<p><h2>Abstract:</h2></p>
<p>In this post we use Trump’s Twitter data to predict whether market volatility (the VIX) will increase that day. To accomplish this we use a Natural Language Processing (NLP) bag-of-words approach with dimensionality reduction through truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for latent sentiment analysis. The predictions are decided by a weighted voting classifier ensemble consisting of hyperparameter tuned logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) of decision trees, and stochastic gradient boosted decision tree models. To handle the large amounts of data we use Dask and sklearn’s joblib for parallel processing as well as sparse matrix data structures. </p>
<p><h2>Background:</h2></p>
<p>To say that President Trump has garnered public attention with his Twitter posts is a gross understatement; one need only look at the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/get-there/wp/2017/06/01/would-you-buy-a-21-99-covfefe-t-shirt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small fortunes being made selling ‘covfefe’ merch on the internet</a> as an indicator of the rapt attention he holds both over his supporters and detractors alike. He is at the same time Jack Dorsey’s greatest enemy and his greatest asset by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-twitter-trump/trump-complained-to-twitter-ceo-about-lost-followers-source-idUSKCN1RZ2D1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drawing the president’s personal ire for his actions</a> and creating a mountain of ad-space revenue in one push of a blue button. Though Obama had a Twitter account as during his administration, it served as a more traditional and benign presence. Even before declaring his intentions to run for office in June of 2015 Trump communicated with Twitter in a way that was direct, unpolished, seemingly always irate, and at times obscene. Now it has become almost expected as a new standard: Can any future president really be seen as engaged with their constituency if their every unfiltered thought is not constantly being uploaded to the clout-cloud?</p>
<p>In this light it has become a common inside joke among investors that they live in constant fear of what his next Tweet will bring to the market. This is not to say other presidents and governmental actions have not affected the market. In an age where securities can be bought and sold in microseconds and a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-54880774" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet can be shared with the general public before even the president’s own staff find out</a>, there can seem to be some evidence for this claim.</p>
<p>Investors can however be a notoriously superstitious bunch; regardless of how many Fibonacci retracements and moving averages you want to throw in a chart, technical “analysis” has very little to do with quantitative mathematics and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zvvJ8hAJN0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">more to do with engagement</a> (besides, backtesting reveals it is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMrGwKlXMTk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">about as effective as flipping a coin</a>). So how do we know if there is any merit to this claim?</p>
