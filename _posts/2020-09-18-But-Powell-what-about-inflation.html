<p><h2>Background:</h2></p>
<p>It is an understatement to say that 2020 has been an unusual year for many. In addition to the loss of life due to COVID-19, the way we live our everyday lives has been affected, and we don’t know when it will go back to normal. Add that uncertainty to the unknown time frame for a vaccine and we get some very scared markets. We certainly felt that volatility in March when we experienced <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-stocks-economy-usa/d-word-rears-head-as-coronavirus-hit-markets-brace-for-recession-idUSKBN2140IA">the worst stock crash since at least 2008, with some calling this the worst since the Great Depression</a>, with the S&P 500 tumbling by nearly 30%.</p>
<p>One advantage of this contraction over those in the past: new tools. The Fed employed quantitative easing (including buying of junk bonds), slashed interest rates to nearly zero, allowed immediate treasury security exchanges for cash-loans with an almost <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-fed-programs-expla/explainer-whatthe-federal-reserve-has-done-in-the-coronavirus-crisis-idUSKBN21I1BK">reckless abandon</a>. Congress put aside petty party differences and whipped up a bill to provide immediate stimulus, protect the unemployed, prevent evictions, and provide small business loans. They even thought about doing it again before settling on <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress/congress-faces-coronavirus-government-funding-battles-as-summer-recess-ends-idUSKBN25V1W7">vacation</a> instead.</p>
<p>Much like the value of the infinite number of ‘Powell make money go brrr’ memes circulating the internet, one would expect all this liquidity to boost inflation. Silver and gold prices sure seem <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-silver-price-graphic/silver-refuses-to-be-left-behind-by-golds-bull-run-idUSKCN24N1ZE">to reflect this</a>. I have personally experienced my Iron Condors on GLD and SLV crashing up by several standard deviations (Black Scholes model). Powell directly contradicts this in his latest speech, where he says <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-instantview/fomc-rates-staying-near-zero-until-inflation-lodges-over-2-idUSKBN26736G">the Fed will keep interest rates near zero until 2023 or inflation reaches 2% again</a>.</p>
<p>Normally inflation is measured by percent change in the CPI. The consumer price index is a market basket that contains items an average consumer would buy. The thing is, spending has been all but average lately. Restaurants shutting down have led to an extreme demand on grocery stores. With no basis for adding floor and shelf space for what is hopefully a temporary situation, there was no choice to drive up the price of groceries. On the other hand items like plane tickets and used cars have their cheapest prices in years. Least to say, this has been a very confusing time for our market basket. The question that naturally arises from this is: Is the CPI accurately reporting our inflation levels with all of this turmoil?</p>
<p>This post aims to explore the validity of CPI in measuring current inflation, and if possible model where inflation should be.</p>
